LAB NETWORK POLICY
Deploy our wordpress solution
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dell-alekseipopov/k8s-devops/966b0bc087bf525bdbee80f01d3a90900c5225f5/wordpress/wordpress.yaml
Once itâ€™s running (verify by browsing the LB)
Create a new network policy named : blockedsql,yaml
This should block all access to our MYSQL DB
Make sure the application is failing and outputting unable to access DB
Create a second network policy that will allow ONLY our frontends to communicate with our DB
Run a 3rd pod that will try to connect to our MYSQL and fail (see next page)
